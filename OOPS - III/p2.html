<!-- 2. *Food Types and Cooking*:
   Define a base class Food with a method cook(). Create subclasses like Pizza, Sushi, and Burger that extend Food and override cook() to depict the cooking process for each food type. Instantiate these food objects and call cook() to display how each type is prepared. -->
